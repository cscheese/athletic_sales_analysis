## Project Description 
This module is second of two modules dedicated to learning Pandas and Jupyter Notebook - Python's Pandas Library and provides additional hands on skills. 

### Brief Description of Challenge (from module assignment)
"You'll analyze sales data to gain insights into which cities in the U.S. have sold the most athletic wear over two years. Next, you'll determine which retailers had the greatest total sales for athletic wear, and which retailers sold the most women's athletic footwear. Finally, you'll determine which day and week had the highest sales for women's athletic footwear."

### Addendum/ Sources & References
Module 5 Activities. Some of this code was created by following along with the course instructor as he demonstrated how to complete the homework by copying and pasting code from course examples and activites.

Resources included: reviewing and going through the class activities and homework, before class tutoring, Xpert Learning Assistant (helpful), some help from ChatGPT 4. I had a tutoring session which helped me trouble shoot code that was not working and code with unexpected output. I'm glad that AskBSCS is up and running again. All these resources were incredibly helpful.
