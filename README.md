## Project Description 
This module is second of two modules dedicated to learning Pandas and Jupyter Notebook

### Brief Description of Challenge (modified from module assignment)
In this module I used sales data to gain insights into which cities in the U.S. sold the most athletic wear over a two year period, which retailers had the greatest total sales for athletic wear, and which retailers sold the most women's athletic footwear. Finally, I determined which day and week had the highest sales for women's athletic footwear.

### Addendum/ Sources & References
Some of the code was created by following along with the course instructor as he demonstrated how to complete the homework by copying and pasting code from course examples and activites. I also used ChatGPT 4o and 4, Xpert Learning Assistant. I had a tutoring session. Finially, I have started a small group study session with another student where we are helping each other better learn the course material. 

### Reflection
ChatGPT are good places to start generating code and trouble shooting, especially syntax, but I don't think it is the place to end. I find there is still a lot of critical thinking and evaluating the output and revising the code independent of the suggestions made by the AI help. I am beginning to understand how this all fits together. This exercise was incredibly helpful in understanding code - generating the same thing first in groupby and then in a pivot table.
